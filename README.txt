This is a little project for IBM recruiting.

We created a website that queries the OpenWeatherMap API using either zip code or city, with a specific temperature unit (Kelvin, C, F).

We then format the result into JSON. The information received is used to fill a Widget with the day's temperature (current, high, low), a description of the weather conditions with a corresponding icon, and zip code or city name. We also draw a map of the location.

The code is a combination of HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. No external libraries or scripts were used excpet for the google maps api.

The files included are:
- WeatherPage.html
- WeatherScript.js
- WeatherStyle.css
- img forlder with all the images and icons
